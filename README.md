# CareerManager
A plugin for KSP that allows for users to lock their "Funds" and "Science" in the career gamemode.

##Some quick words
I wanted to make a mod but Im shit at coding. I was messing around in a career mode save and was wondering if I could find a mod that would allow me to have infinite money and science. After some looking, I stumbled across this mod:

https://github.com/tivec/CareerLite/.

It did exactly what I wanted to do, but it wasnt in development. Since it had an appropirate licence, I starting editing the mod, fixing a few bugs and recompiling it. I hope that you guys enjoy it, and if you have any suggestions or issues, please let me know!

##CareerManager
Like I said above, this mod allows you to lock your funds in a career game. It also has the additional features of toppling the tech tree and also unlocking all the buildings.
You can essentially do the same thing from the debug menu, but I found this more elegant, I figured some other people may aswell.

##Future Plans
-Saving the pre-existing funds to a external file
-Better icon
